# Next.js 15 App Router Unexpected 404 Error

This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15's App Router where a 404 error is returned even when navigating to a page that exists.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs when navigating between pages within the App directory.  In some cases, even though the route correctly maps to a page component, Next.js returns a 404 error.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/` (the home page).  This works as expected.
5. Navigate to other existing pages within the app directory. A 404 error may occur inconsistently.

## Potential Causes

This issue might stem from various factors such as improper file structuring, route definition conflicts within the app directory, or edge-case scenarios within the Next.js routing system itself.

## Solution

The solution involved reviewing the app directory structure to make sure it strictly follows the file-based routing conventions of the Next.js App Router.  This often includes careful review of page file naming, nested directory structures, and the dynamic routes configured in the routes directory. Any subtle errors in these areas can easily cause unexpected 404 errors.
