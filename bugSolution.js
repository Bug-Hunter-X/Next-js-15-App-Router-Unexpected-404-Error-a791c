```javascript
// pages/index.js
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>Hello World!</div>
  );
}
// Ensure the file structure and naming conventions are correctly aligned with the Next.js App Router documentation.
// Double check that the `app` directory structure and route definitions are well-structured and consistent.
// Verify that the component files are named correctly (e.g. `page.js`, `layout.js`, etc.) and are located within expected directory structures.
// If using dynamic segments, confirm the routes are properly defined in the `app` directory (and not in the `pages` directory if using the App Router).
// Use Next.js's built-in debugging tools and the developer console to check for any route-related errors or warnings.
